# Dementia Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting dementia using a dataset of patient information. The goal of this project is to build predictive models that can assist in early diagnosis and treatment planning for dementia.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numeric features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Provides insights into the dataset through visualizations and statistical analysis.
- Modeling: Implements various machine learning models to predict dementia status.
- Evaluation: Compares model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Key Components

1. Data Preparation:
   - Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset.
   - Handling missing data and feature engineering.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   - Statistical summaries of the data.
   - Visualizations such as histograms, correlation heatmaps, and box plots to understand feature relationships.

3. Machine Learning Models:
   - Various models like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines are trained.
   - Hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation.

4. Performance Evaluation:
   - Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix are used to assess models.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dementia-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Load the dataset by running the notebook.
2. Preprocess the data and perform exploratory data analysis.
3. Train the machine learning models and evaluate their performance.
4. Use the best-performing model for predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset contains anonymized patient information, including demographic data, clinical test results, and cognitive assessments. Details about the dataset and its source can be found in the project documentation.

## Results

The models are evaluated based on their ability to predict dementia accurately. Detailed performance metrics and results are available in the notebook.
